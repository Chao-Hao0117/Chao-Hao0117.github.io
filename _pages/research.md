*Research Assistant* | Advisor: Prof. Xiaohui Zhang, Capital University of Economics and Business
*Beijing, China | [cite_start]Sep 2015 – Jul 2016* [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]Valued commercial banks using an Economic Value Added (EVA) model via systematic accounting adjustments and capital cost analysis [cite: 27][cite_start]; improved beta estimation by identifying key drivers through multivariate regression, developing a highly predictive model[cite: 28].
* Independently executed a full-cycle empirical study from data processing and model specification to results testing, demonstrating rigorous quantitative analysis[cite: 29].
* [cite_start]Validated model efficacy through robustness checks and economic interpretation, showcasing the ability to solve complex financial problems[cite: 30].
